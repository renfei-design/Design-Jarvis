# Per-Phase Anti-Patterns

All anti-patterns to avoid during each phase of a design system build.

---

## Phase 0 (Discovery) Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Starting to create anything before scope is locked with user
- ❌ Ignoring existing file conventions and imposing new ones
- ❌ Skipping `search_design_system` before planning component creation

## Phase 1 (Foundations) Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Using `ALL_SCOPES` on any variable
- ❌ Duplicating raw values in semantic layer instead of aliasing
- ❌ Not setting code syntax (breaks Dev Mode and round-tripping)
- ❌ Creating component tokens before agreeing on token taxonomy

## Phase 2 (File Structure) Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Skipping the cover page or foundations docs
- ❌ Putting multiple unrelated components on one page

## Phase 3 (Components) Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Creating components before foundations exist
- ❌ Hardcoding any fill/stroke/spacing/radius value in a component
- ❌ Creating a variant per icon (use INSTANCE_SWAP instead)
- ❌ Not positioning variants after combineAsVariants (they all stack at 0,0)
- ❌ Building variant matrix > 30 without splitting (variant explosion)
- ❌ Importing remote components then immediately detaching them

## General Anti-Patterns (All Phases)

- ❌ Retrying a failed script without understanding the error first
- ❌ Using name-prefix matching for cleanup (deletes user-owned nodes)
- ❌ Building on unvalidated work from the previous step
- ❌ Skipping user checkpoints to "save time"
- ❌ Parallelizing `use_figma` calls (always sequential)
- ❌ Guessing/hallucinating node IDs from memory (always read from state ledger)
- ❌ Writing massive inline scripts instead of using the provided helper scripts
- ❌ Starting Phase 3 because the user said "build the button" without completing Phases 0-2
